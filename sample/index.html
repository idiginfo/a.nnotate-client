<h2>A.nnotate API samples / test routines</h2>

<p>
This directory includes some sample code for calling the
<a href='http://a.nnotate.com/api.html'>A.nnotate API</a>.  The sample code is fairly basic and intended
to demonstrate the process of calling the web APIs; writing equivalents
in languages other than PHP should be straightforward.
<i>(for Java programmers: There is a basic example for Java too: 
 the <code>java/</code> subdirectory includes a sample 
<code><a href='java/AnnotateApi.java'>AnnotateApi.java</a></code>
for signing an A.nnotate API request from Java and parsing the JSON 
response.)</i>
</p>


<h3>1. Configuration file</h3>

<p>
You need to create a configuration file: <b>test_config.php</b> file before running 
any of the tests. A sample is provided in 'test_config.orig' so first of all:
</p>

<pre>
  cp test_config.orig test_config.php
  vi test_config.php   # or your preferred text editor...
</pre>

<p>
 The <b>apiuser</b> should be set to the email of the
admin user of your a.nnotate installation, and the <b>apikey</b>
is displayed at the bottom of the apiuser's a.nnotate account page.
(if you don't see the apikey on your account page, check
that the setting <code>$enableapi = 1; </code> is present
in your php/config.tmp file).
 You can change the
<b>sampleDate</b> and <b>sampleCode</b> once you have uploaded
a document, as they are used in the later tests.
</p>

<pre>
  $apiuser = "you@yoursite.com";
  $apikey = "iMMbpfKyRPm5s3n8zayr8RPT8chhLZvk";

  $annotateServer = "http://localhost/annotate";

  // The sample annotate user.
  $sampleUser = "joe@example.com";
  $sampleSig = "joe";

  // Another sample user.
  $sampleUser2 = "jill@example.com";
  $sampleSig2 = "jill";

  // Sample document date / code:
  // *** Replace these with the values returned after uploading a document ***
  $sampleDate = "2008-07-15";
  $sampleCode = "jIKdZcO2";
</pre>



<h3>2. List of files</h3>


<pre>
# Configuration settings
  # <b>Important: Edit this before running any tests</b>
  test_config.php

# Utility functions
  HMAC.php        --- Crypt_HMAC class to calculate hashes for signing requests
  JSON.php        --- json_encode and json_decode functions
  annotateApi.php --- signRequest() function for signing API requests

# HTML samples (view these in browser)
  html_uploadDocument.php      --- upload a document
  html_updateDocumentMeta.php  --- edit document level notes / tags / title
  html_viewSample.php          --- view a document
  html_addNote.php             --- add a note
  html_loginAs.php             --- login as a given A.nnotate user
  html_error.php               --- display an error message

# Test PHP samples (run from command line)
  test_createAccount.php   --- create an A.nnotate account via API
  test_updateAccount.php   --- change account settings
  test_authorizeReader.php --- allow a given user to view a document
  test_deleteDocument.php  --- delete a document

  test_listDocuments.php   --- display a list of documents {+metadata/notes} for a user
  test_listFolders.php     --- list folders for a user
  test_listNotes.php       --- list notes for a document
  test_listUsers.php       --- list user accounts

  test_shareFolders.php    --- create and share folders
</pre>

<p>
  The test scripts all include the <b>annotateApi.php</b> utility functions
  which includes the definition of <b>signRequest()</b>, used to add
  a hash code to authenticate API requests.
</p>

<p>
  You may find it useful to check the Amazon S3 Web Services sample code
  for equivalent libraries in other languages (Java / ASP etc), as the
  authentication mechanism used for the A.nnotate API is similar
  to that used for S3.
</p>

<p>
The samples starting <b>test_...</b> are intended to be run
from the command line. The samples starting <b>html_...</b> are
intended to be viewed in a browser.
</p>



<h3>3. Creating a.nnotate accounts using the API</h3>

<p>
From the command line...
</p>
<pre>
  php test_createAccount.php
      --- creates new accounts for the two sample users specified in 'test_config.php'
</pre>

<p>
Accounts are initially created as 'annotators' - to license them
to upload documents, you need to call <b>updateAccount.php</b>.
This can also be used to change the short signature used to sign notes, 
and the user's a.nnotate password.
</p>

<pre>
  php test_updateAccount.php
</pre>

<p>
You can check that the accounts have been added by viewing your
server admin page (php/serverAdmin.php in your installation, 
there's a link from your account page too when logged in as the admin
user).
</p>


<h3>4. Login as a given user and view list of documents</h3>

<p>
You can use the API to create links from your web application
to log users in to their a.nnotate account automatically.
This can be useful if you already have your own user authentication
system and do not want users to have to log in separately to A.nnotate.
The <b>html_loginAs.php</b> sample lets you authenticate as a particular user and
then display the list of documents, notes, or a particular document.
Login as sample users with the link: <a href='html_loginAs.php' target='_blank'>html_loginAs.php</a>
</p>



<h3>5. Upload a document to a user account</h3>

<p>
  Open the browser at <a target='_blank' href='html_uploadDocument.php'>html_uploadDocument.php</a>
  and browse for a PDF document to try uploading. It should display a message like <code>OK 2008-01-01 abc123</code>. You could use the return values to set the <b>$sampleDate</b> and <b>$sampleCode</b> values  
in the test_config.php file to the uploaded document.
</p>


<h3>6. View the sample document</h3>

<p>
  Once you've edited the $sampleCode and $sampleDate settings in your test_config.php,
  you can point the browser at <a target='_blank' href='html_viewSample.php'>html_viewSample.php</a>
  to make a public link to the document.
</p>


<h3>7. Adding a note using the API</h3>

<p>
  The <a target='_blank' href='html_addNote.php'>html_addNote.php</a> sample 
  lets you add notes to PDF documents using the API. It uses a HTTP POST 
  with a number of parameters (note text, where it is attached etc).
  After adding a note, you might want to <a target='_blank' href='html_viewSample.php'>html_viewSample.php</a>
  again and press 'reload' to see it.
</p>


<h3>8. Editing a document's metadata using the API</h3>

<p>
  The <a target='_blank' href='html_updateDocumentMeta.php'>html_updateDocumentMeta.php</a> sample 
  lets you edit the document's metadata (title, tags, notes, authors). It uses a HTTP POST.
  The values you set will overwrite any previous values. After saving the metadata, you may wish to 
 <a target='_blank' href='html_viewSample.php'>html_viewSample.php</a> and use the <b>Tools &gt; properties</b>
menu to check that the metadata has been updated.  This call can also be used to set 
annotation permissions on a document, to restrict to particular users or pages.
</p>



<h3>9. Extracting a user's list of documents in structured form</h3>

<p>
The <b>test_listDocuments.php</b> sample lists the documents for a given
user, returned as a JSON array. The parameters are the start / end month, 
and you can choose whether to return the extended document level metadata
and notes along with the basic date / code / name. Run this sample (and all
the test_... samples) from the command line:
</p>

<pre>
  php test_listDocuments.php
</pre>



<h3>10. Extracting the list of notes on a document</h3>

<p>
You can fetch the notes on a single document using <b>test_listNotes.php</b>.
It returns a JSON array which includes the document metadata as well as the notes.
</p>

<pre>
  php test_listNotes.php
</pre>


<h3>11. Listing user accounts</h3>
<p>
 <b>test_listUsers.php</b> lists the email addresses of the a.nnotate
accounts you administer. The return value is a JSON object with 
two array fields "members" and "annotators", both arrays of email addresses.
</p>

<pre>
  php test_listUsers.php
</pre>

<h3>12. Authorizing a user to view a document</h3>
<p>
 <b>test_authorizeReader.php</b> adds a given document to a
user's documents list. Note that you can also simply send the 
user a link to the document like that in <a target='_blank' href='html_viewSample.php'>html_viewSample.php</a>;
in that case the document would only get added to the user's list if/when they click on the link.
</p>

<pre>
  php test_authorizeReader.php
</pre>


<h3>13. Deleting a document</h3>

<p>
The <b>test_deleteDocument.php</b> sample shows how to remove 
a document from a user's list.
</p>

<pre>
  # you may want to wait until you've run the other tests
  # before deleting the sample document...
  php test_deleteDocument.php
</pre>

<p>
View <a target='_blank' href='html_createFolder.php'>html_createFolder.php</a> to create
 a new folder in the test user's account.
</p>
